TACO Documentation
==================

Welcome to TACO's documentation!

**TACO** (Pose Graph Optimization) is a Python library for robust 6-DOF pose estimation
by fusing IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data with CVGL (Computer Vision Global Localization)
image-based measurements.

Features
--------

- **Pose Graph Optimization**: Build and optimize pose graphs from multiple sensor modalities
- **IMU Integration**: Process accelerometer and gyroscope data with preintegration support
- **CVGL Localization**: Image-based global localization with uncertainty quantification
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combine odometry and absolute pose measurements
- **Visualization**: Plot trajectories and pose graphs in 3D
